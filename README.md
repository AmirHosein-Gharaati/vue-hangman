## Summary

In this video, we will be converting a hangman project created by Brad Traversy
into a Vue 3 project using the composition API. This project comes from his
course called 20 web projects with vanilla javascript and he has also posted a
video about converting this project into a modern react app.

We will not be changing any of the app's functionality but instead, we will be
breaking it down into components and re-implementing the logic in Vue. We will be
using many new techniques introduced in Vue 3 such as creating a reusable
function that handles the keypress event. This function can then be used in any
of your future projects. You should stick around util the end to see how to do
that. This video assumes you already have a basic understanding of the Vue 3
Composition API, which if you have been following the Vue 3 series you should
have, otherwise I recommend you check the vue series.
